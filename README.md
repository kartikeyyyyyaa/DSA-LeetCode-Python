# DSA-LeetCode-Python
A comprehensive collection of efficient LeetCode solutions implemented in Python. Documenting my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and tracking my daily coding streak.
# 🐍 DSA LeetCode Solutions (Python)

Welcome to my coding repository! I am **Kartikeya Shukla**, an engineering student at **VIT Bhopal**. This repository documents my journey solving 1600+ LeetCode problems to master Data Structures and Algorithms.

## 🚀 Repository Goals
- **Consistency:** Solving problems daily to build a continuous "Green Wall" on GitHub.
- **Optimization:** Focusing on Time and Space complexity.
- **Growth:** Transitioning from Python mastery to C++ proficiency.

## 📂 Folder Structure
The solutions are organized by pattern/topic for easy revision:
- `/Arrays` - Sliding Window, Two Pointers
- `/DP` - Dynamic Programming approaches
- `/Graphs` - BFS, DFS, Union Find
- `/Strings` - String manipulation techniques

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3
- **Platform:** LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks
